                    <div class="para-1"><p>One of every five children,teens and adults in India are diagonised with mental illness. And they suffer from 
                        depression, anxiety issues where they fail to open up to their closed ones which affect their as well as their closed ones' lives.</p></div>

                    <div class="para-2"><p>While doctor, therapist and medicine are necessary, but they are not enough.
                        Suicide rates continue to rise especially among teens who can't handle much academic or parental or peer pressure.</p></div>

                    <div class="para-3"><p>When someone's life is interrupted by mental illness it can be tough to see a practical way
                        forward with day to day life and a good future seems out of reach.</p></div>

                    <div class="para-4"><p>During such times people apart from medical help need emotional help which generally can't be provided by their closed ones as they 
                        themselves haven't gone through similar conditions.  Here comes our website "Peace Seekers" where people who are suffering 
                        from similar kind of issues can interact with each other and can rely on someone they don't know as it's said that sometimes talking to a 
                        complete stranger feels better than talking to someone you know as they would never judge you and can be vulnerable to each other.</p></div>

                    <div class="para-5"><p>We want to provide a platform where people can themselves get an idea of what is actually happening to their mind,
                        can interact with similar people and can get hope andand try to uplift themselves without any treatment.
                        People can get specialised doctor's help and can attend meditation sessions through this platform.
                        We intend to support people who have completely lost their hopes and spread their life with 
                        happiness and peace <i class="fa-solid fa-dove"></i> .</p></div>
